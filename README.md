# halo-ce-pve-aimbot
This is a crappy aimbot made in cheat engine for halo ce (the gearbox port, not mcc). Right now, the lua bot only works properly on Truth and Reconciliation since unit ids are not consistent across levels. There's also a texture dumping/swapping dll injection for use with texture based aimbots.
